Some information about George brown college:

George Brown College is located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and was established in 1967. It was named after a prominent 19th century politician, journalist, and one of Canada's "Fathers of Confederation". Originally it began as the Provincial Institute of Trades in 1951 but transitioned into the more applied arts and technology focused school it is today.

George Brown currently has 3 locations across Toronto:

Casa Loma Campus (Best campus by far)
St. James Campus
and the Waterfront Campus

Casa Loma focuses on construction, engineering, and health sciences, while the SJC is centered around business, hospitality and culinary arts. Finally the waterfront campus is a forerunner in health sciences programs with a primary focus on nursing and dental health.

Though many courses are offered and thousands of students attend across all campuses, the Computer Programming and Analysis is number one ;)
