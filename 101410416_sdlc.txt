Learning DevOps is crucial for modern software development as it bridges the gap between development
 and operations teams, promoting faster delivery of high-quality software.
  In the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), DevOps practices improve collaboration, automate repetitive tasks, and ensure continuous integration and delivery, reducing deployment risks.
   By integrating DevOps, teams can detect and fix bugs earlier in the development process, leading to faster releases and more stable systems. DevOps also emphasizes scalability,
    which is essential for managing larger and more complex projects in todayâ€™s dynamic IT landscape.
