Toronto is home to many major industries in Canada and is one of the most important economic hubs in North America. As such, the city becomes a living lab for our students. We have three campuses and several locations that place students in the heart of downtown Toronto — St. James Campus, Casa Loma Campus and Waterfront Campus.

We’ve taken advantage of our location to give our students an edge in the job market. We partner with companies and organizations that play a role in the academic life of our students by advising course curriculum, and providing field education and employment. By helping us develop curriculum, these companies nurture our students to meet industry needs and gain skills that are highly sought after in the current job market.
